In general we can discuss in German, English and Spanish. If it is a listening only mode I understand Dutch and SchwyzerdÃ¼tsch.

## Video
Here will be a short video of how you could get started. From 0 to hero - Setting up your own SeniorenSmarthome with HomeAssistant, InfluxDB, Grafana and the Home Assistant Companion App (that also allowes you receive critical notifications - even if you iOS device is in Silent Mode). It is a demo using Virtual Box so that literally everyone can start rigt away with a Virtual Machine. If you are using the Apple M1 Chip Virtual Box is not working for you. If you are a M1 user please tell us how you would set up avirtual machine on your Apple Personal Computer device.
